    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here are just some interesting gems and other software that have caught my attention recently:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">oh-my-zsh</a> makes it easy to use zshell as a replacement for bash on OS X. It is very easy to install and comes with a whole bunch of useful plugins. I've only really dived half into it but already feel like it's been making my console better. I personally love how it shows the Git branch I'm working on at the moment.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">Bloom Filters</a> are a very cool way of doing a quick and space efficient lookup if an item exists in a set. It's used by databases and caches, and Google uses it for their Save Browsing service. There's some cool <a href="https://github.com/igrigorik/bloomfilter-rb">ruby gems</a> that make it easy to use them and I already have an idea where to deploy them next.</li>
<li><a href="http://zachholman.com/talk/how-github-uses-github-to-build-github">How Github uses Github</a> is pretty much how we use Github at EmberAds. The more we do it the more I see the benefits especially:

<ul>
<li>We work asynchronously</li>
<li>We use the hell out of Campfire</li>
<li>Master is always deployable</li>
<li>Pull Requests are our code reviews, requests for comments, and discussion boards.</li>
<li>Other apps have great features like prioritising stuff. But honestly, we have barely touched BaseCamp in weeks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/EmberAds/cuuid">Fast UUID generation</a> is something we needed at EmberAds seeing as we use UUIDs everywhere and most of the Ruby gems were rather slow.    <a href="http://caius.name">Caius</a> cooked up a Ruby gem that uses a native C library which in our simple benchmarks spit out UUIDs about 6x faster.</li>
<li>On that note, <a href="https://github.com/EmberAds/acts_as_uuid">acts_as_uuid</a> is what we use to store UUIDs on our models in Postgres.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ondrejbartas/rake-progressbar">Rake progressbar</a> makes it easier for me to understand if I can go and make a brew or not when some of my rake tasks are running.</li>
<li>And finally, static site generators like <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/">Nanoc</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, and <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> (used on this site) have been really catching my eye lately. Mainly because of the security and scaling implications. I've been working on a blog post on this, mainly to inspire regular bloggers that you don't need a big server and a massive database to render a Wordpress site that will load slow as hell regardless.</li>
</ul>
