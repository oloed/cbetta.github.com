    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of my friends, <a href="http://artisanofcode.com/">Dan</a>, started a document called <a href="http://hackdaymanifesto.com/">&#8220;The Hack Day Manifesto&#8221;</a> on the #GeeksOfLondon IRC channel a few days back. With the help of our community we managed to update it to a full document and it&#8217;s now live.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a must read if you ever plan to run a hack day or hackathon.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s already signed by quite a few hackday organisers including the GeeksOfLondon team and you can add your own name by simply <a href="https://github.com/hackdaymanifesto/hackdaymanifesto.github.com/">forking</a>, adding your name, and making a pull request.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It has been a while since I last blogged, and to be fair I&#8217;ve been kinda busy, but I also was frustrated with my old blog. It was bloated and heavy to load, all mainly due to Wordpress and Site5&#8217;s shared hosting. Wordpress started as a nice blogging platform but lately it has been pissing me off (more on this), and I realised that running a whole PHP script for pages that barely ever change is stupid.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>So here is the new blog. The old one is still available <a href="http://blog.cristianobetta.com/">here</a> as a static HTML archive (hence why it loads so fast).</p>

<p>This new blog is built using <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>, which is a &#8220;blog aware static site generator&#8221;. Basically what it does is convert a whole folder of template files and blog posts written in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">MarkDown</a> into a whole folder of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I&#8217;ve been using a few simple frameworks like <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/">Nanoc</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> for work and event management recently and I loved the speed. No database and no server side scripting results in super fast load times, combing that with the hosting on <a href="http://pages.github.com">Github</a> (see here to learn how to do this yourself) makes it even faster.</p>

<p>But let&#8217;s quit talking about the technical details of my blog, or maybe not. I definitely want to share some more techie things here, highlight some of the code I personally write, workflows we use at <a href="http://emberads.com/">EmberAds</a>, and software I love using. Although it&#8217;s fun to blog about anything at random, I rather make this blog a bit more topical (hence the cheesy title).</p>
